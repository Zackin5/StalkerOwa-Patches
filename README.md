# StalkerOwa-Patches
Compatibility patches for [Old World Addon](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/152-old-world-addon) mod for STALKER Anomaly

## Animation For Looting - Animation 2

OWA UI compatable position for the Animation 2 from [Animation for Looting Takes Time](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/animation-for-looting-takes-time).

## Shaders Merge

Compatability patch for [Enhanced Shaders](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/enhanced-shaders-and-color-grading-for-151) (only tested with non-PBR version) and [Screen Space Shaders](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/screen-space-shaders). It's also technically not OWA-exclusive, should work on a normal Anomaly install (pending on other addons.)

## Beef's NVGs ES SSS OWA Mergepatch

Compatability patch for [Beef's NVGs](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/beefs-shader-based-nvgs-v10), OWA, and the above shaders merge.

## Beef's NVGs Tweaks

More realistic NVG tweaks, currently just (really noisy) green for Gen 1, and white phospor for Gen 2 and 3.

## HD Models Lite OWA Patch

Compatability patch for [HD Models Lite](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/anomaly-hd-models-addon-151-lite) (may work with the non-lite version, untested.) It's a quickly hacked together patch, so things like profile pictures may not match. Also requires you to manually exclude the HD Model UI textures from install.

## StalkerAna-FxaaShaders

Copy of the Reshade FastNoise2 noise shader from my [Call of Pripyat port](https://github.com/Zackin5/StalkerCop-FxaaShaders), also includes a new vignette effect for the gas mask lens shader.
