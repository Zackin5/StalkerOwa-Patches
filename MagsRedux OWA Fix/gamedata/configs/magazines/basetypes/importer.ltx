;files in this folder describe magazine [base_type]s
;magazines that share a base_type can be used by any gun that supports that base type.
;a base_type only supports a single caliber. This is to prevent putting a magazine in a gun that can't use the bullets it contains.
;Real world example: All AK-74 magazines have a raised horizontal rib on each side of the rear lug to prevent their use in a 7.62Ã—39mm AK.
;Weapons are asosiated with a base_type in ltx files in  magazines2/weapons . Weapons that can have thier caliber changed ing game will also have thier base_type changed. 
;If you have an AEK retooled from 5.45x39 to 5.56x45 (efectivly making an AEK-971 into a 972) you would also change the magzine well from acepting ak-74 magazies to taking ak-101 magazines.
