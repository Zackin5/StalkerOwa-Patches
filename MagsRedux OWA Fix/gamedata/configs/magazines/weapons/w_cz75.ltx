;do not edit this file to add new magazines, create a new file in this folder with a name starting with mag_. 
; include an idetifier for the addon that adds the gun such as `bas`
;What ammo a mag takes as well as what guns it fits are determined by it's base_type. see configs/magazines2/base_types/_importer.ltx for explanation of base_type
;weapons are listed parrent_section for multi scope weapons, and section for all others
;default_mag is the magazine the gun will spawn with, also used for traders
;base_type is listed with the first entry in the guns ammo_class list
;for guns with rechamber upgrades the base_type for that caliber is listed under the first entry in the upgrades ammo_class list

;pistols are deceptive as most of them have custom mags, for a compleate understanding look at a number of AK and STANAG rifles
